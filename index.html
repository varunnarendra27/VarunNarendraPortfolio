                        <p>This project was my first introduction to pulling, committing and pushing via git using GitLab. It also taught me the importance of Test Driven Development to promote continuous change in code, documentation and the ability to fail fast to make sure a clear direction in production is followed. JavaFX was also a skill that I learned, allowing configuration of the front-end based on the back-end. As apart of this project I had to create a design via a UML Diagram that explained the creational, structural and behavioural design patterns I was planning on using. Lastly it taught me the importance of consistent commenting via javadoc to show other developers how my other programs function.

                        <p>The aim of this project was to create an interface that a restaurant can use to order, and keep track of food. This project has taught me the importance of using Git to work collaboratively in a team by committing and merging code with others. Having the opportunity to code in HTML and CSS to design a website that can communicate with the backend was a particular highlight in this project for me.</p>
